# Vapor Design

This repo contains all of the materials used for building out Vapor's design across its many sites. It contains the reference designs and files from designers in [Reference](/Reference/) and build pipelines and code to generate the necessary files to be included in Vapor's sites. These are automatically deployed to design.vapor.codes - hosted on our CDN - and then included in the different sites.

There is an example site in [Example](/Example/) to show you how it's used.
